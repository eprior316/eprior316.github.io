Hi, I'm Beth! I am a remote sensing and geospatial scientist with over six years of experience collecting, processing, and analyzing Earth observation data to study geomorphic, hydraulic, and hydrologic processes across spatial and temporal scales. I recently completed my Ph.D. in [Biological Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech](https://www.bse.vt.edu/) through the [Remote Sensing Interdisciplinary Graduate Education Program](https://rsigep.frec.vt.edu/), where my research integrated multi-sensor remote sensing, hydrodynamic modeling, and quantitative analysis to address real-world environmental and geomorphic challenges, including river hydraulics modeling, floodplain dynamics processes, and the nexus of hydropower operations and river corridor conservation.

My work leverages photogrammetry, multispectral imagery, and lidar from satellites, aircraft, and drones collected by own field campaigns, NGOs, and federal agencies. I am an expert across the full remote sensing pipeline, from collecting and processing Earth observation data to translating results into actionable insights. I am experienced in with the entire modeling lifecycle, including data QA/QC for model inputs, model implementation, calibration and validation, and analysis of modeled results. This is all complimented by my domain expertise in water resources engineering, surface water hydrology, and floodplain dynamics, with experience applying similar analytical and remote sensing approaches to forestry and coastal systems.

I have collaborated with interdisciplinary teams through externally funded research at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the U.S. Geological Survey, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. I strive to bridge the gap between remote sensing science, geospatial analytics, and practical applications across research, industry, or NGO settings. I am passionate about solving complex spatial problems that advance environmental understanding and decision making.
